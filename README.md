# StampExpert
Identify and catalog stamps from around the world with our advanced recognition system. Discover rarity, origin, and historical significance of your stamp collection.

## Installation
Run `npm install` to install development dependencies.

## Development
Start a local development server that serves the files in `public/` with:

```bash
npm run start
```

This serves the content in the `public/` directory so you can open the interface in your browser.

You can also run the Node.js API server which serves the same static files and exposes a stub `/api/analyze` endpoint:

```bash
npm run server
```

## Build
Create a production build in the `dist/` directory with:

```bash
npm run build
```
