## Installation
Run `npm install` to install development dependencies.

## Development
Start the application server from the project root with:

```bash
npm start
```

The command executes `server.js`, which serves the content in the `public/` folder and exposes a stub `/api/analyze` endpoint. Once it starts you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the URL shown in the terminal) in your browser to use the app.

## Build
Create a production build in the `dist/` directory with:

```bash
npm run build
```
